 * This is a special kind of grouping. A stream grouped this way means that the
 * producer of the tuple decides which task of the consumer will receive this
 * tuple. Direct groupings can only be declared on streams that have been
 * declared as direct streams. Tuples emitted to a direct stream must be emitted
 * using one of the emitDirect methods. A bolt can get the task ids of its
 * consumers by either using the provided TopologyContext or by keeping track of
 * the output of the emit method in OutputCollector (which returns the task ids
 * that the tuple was sent to).
